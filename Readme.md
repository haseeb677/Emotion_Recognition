# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Recognition with Streamlit, OpenCV & TensorFlow

This project detects **human facial emotions in real-time** using a webcam and a CNN model trained on categorized facial expressions. The application features a **Streamlit web interface**, **live video processing with OpenCV**, **logging using SQLite**, and optional **Telegram alerts** for critical emotion detection.

## ✅ Features

- 🎥 Real-time webcam capture and face detection
- 😄 Emotion classification (Angry, Happy, Sad, etc.)
- 🧠 CNN-based model trained on grayscale emotion datasets
- 📊 Emotion logging with timestamps using SQLite
- 🖥️ Streamlit dashboard for live monitoring
- 🔔 Optional: Telegram alerts for specific emotions
